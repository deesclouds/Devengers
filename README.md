If you're a collaborator, go to the Github Repo page, Git clone the project, and cd into the directory. 

**Don't fork it!**
Forking will copy it in a new Repo to your Github page, but you don't want that - you want to collaborate on the same Github Repo with your team.

# Getting Set up

```
**clone with SSH**
git clone git@github.com:deesclouds/Devengers.git

**clone with HTTPS**
git clone https://github.com/deesclouds/Devengers.git
